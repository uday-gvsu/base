# Team name: E-commerce platform (or) SAD Project

Team members: Uday Surneni - https://github.com/uday-gvsu/CIS641-HW2-Surneni

# Introduction

The project aims to develop a basic e-commerce platform tailored for small businesses and individual merchants to sell their products online. The platform will allow users to browse a product catalog, search for items by keyword, and make purchases, fulfilling the growing demand for digital shopping. Additionally, the system will provide a secure checkout process and feature a product review system to improve customer trust and engagement. This platform will increase revenue for small businesses by enabling an accessible online presence and enhancing customer satisfaction through an easy-to-use interface. The system’s scalability ensures the possibility for future enhancements, such as advanced search features and personalized product recommendations.

# Anticipated Technologies

The platform will be built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, while the backend will utilize Node.js or Ruby on Rails with MySQL or SQLite for database management. Additionally, a secure payment gateway like Stripe or PayPal will be integrated to facilitate safe transactions. AWS or Heroku may be used for hosting the system.

# Method/Approach

The project plan for developing a basic e-commerce platform begins with finalizing requirements and designing the UI/UX (Week 1-2), followed by setting up the frontend and backend using technologies like Node.js and MySQL (Week 2-3). Product catalog and search functionality are implemented in Weeks 3-4, with shopping cart and secure checkout added in Weeks 5-6. Week 7 focuses on integrating the payment gateway and customer review system. Security measures and responsive design are optimized in Week 8. The project concludes with testing, bug fixes, and platform deployment in Weeks 9-10, ensuring scalability and security. Key challenges include secure payment integration, responsive design, and handling scalability.

# Estimated Timeline

• Week 1-2: Finalize project requirements and complete UI/UX design. • Week 3-4: Develop the product catalog and implement search functionality. • Week 5-6: Create and integrate the shopping cart and secure checkout system. • Week 7: Implement the payment gateway and add the customer review system. • Week 8: Ensure data security and system responsiveness across devices. • Week 9-10: Conduct thorough testing, fix bugs, and deploy the platform.

# Anticipated Problems

• Challenges may arise in integrating the payment gateway securely and ensuring data protection for sensitive customer information. Additionally, ensuring that the platform is fully responsive across all devices may pose some technical hurdles. Scaling the platform to handle high traffic during seasonal sales could also be a potential issue.
